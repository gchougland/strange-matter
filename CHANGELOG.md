# Changelog

All notable changes to Strange Matter will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-13

### Added

- **Resonant Conduits**
  - Added Resonant Conduit block for transferring resonant energy between machines
  - Modular conduit system that connects from any side depending on adjacent machines or conduits
  - Dynamic rendering system with custom UV mapping:
    - Straight connections: 5x5 pixel tubes
    - Corners/intersections: 7x7 pixel joint in center with 5x5 tubes extending
    - Joint only renders when needed (not for straight across connections)
    - Single texture with different UV coordinates for tubes and joints
  - Custom block entity renderer with proper texture atlas integration
  - Crafting recipe: 4 Resonite Ingots + 4 Resonant Circuits → 8 Resonant Conduits
  - Conduits act as pure energy routers (no energy storage) with direct source-to-sink routing
  - Event-driven network updates with BFS pathfinding for energy transfer optimization
  - Compatible with all existing energy machines (Resonant Burner, Resonance Condenser, etc.)

- **Enhanced Energy System**
  - **Role-Based Energy Transfer**: Machines now have defined energy roles (GENERATOR, CONSUMER, BOTH, ENERGY_INDEPENDENT)
  - **Unidirectional Energy Flow**: 
    - Resonant Burner: Only supplies energy (GENERATOR role)
    - Resonance Condenser: Only accepts energy (CONSUMER role)
    - Reality Forge: Energy independent (ENERGY_INDEPENDENT role)
    - Rift Stabilizer: Only supplies energy (GENERATOR role)
  - **Improved Client/Server Synchronization**: Fixed energy bar jumping issues with proper block entity data sync
  - **Every-Tick Processing**: All machines now process every tick instead of every 20 ticks for better responsiveness
  - **Capability Exposure Control**: Energy capabilities only exposed on configured input/output sides

### Fixed

- **Energy Transfer Issues**
  - Fixed energy bars jumping up and down during transfer operations
  - Fixed client/server synchronization conflicts by ensuring energy logic runs only server-side
  - Fixed energy transfer between multiple machines of the same type (generators no longer transfer to each other)
  - Fixed conduit allowing cross-transfer between incompatible machine types
  - Improved energy transfer batching to prevent multiple sync packets from conflicting

- **Rift Stabilizer Integration**
  - Modified Rift Stabilizer to extend BaseMachineBlockEntity for full integration with role-based energy system
  - Fixed Rift Stabilizer energy generation by resolving internal energy storage configuration
  - Added proper tick counter system for rift detection (every 20 ticks) while maintaining every-tick energy generation
  - Fixed energy output configuration to match block facing direction

- **Machine Timing**
  - Fixed BaseMachineBlockEntity to call processMachine() every tick instead of every 20 ticks
  - Individual machines can now implement their own internal timing for specific operations
  - Improved responsiveness for all energy generation and consumption operations
  - Removed global tick synchronization in favor of distributed processing

- **Village Structure Integration**
  - Fixed `NoSuchFieldException: rawTemplates` error on dedicated servers
  - Enhanced field detection to handle both obfuscated (f_210559_, f_210560_) and deobfuscated (rawTemplates, templates) field names
  - Added robust error handling and debug logging for field discovery
  - Village structure injection now works reliably across all server environments (client, server, dedicated server)
