vEctoplasm Item Texture
======================

This should be a 16x16 pixel texture with the following characteristics:

- Primary color: #41b280 (teal-green)
- Soft, glowing appearance
- Semi-transparent or translucent
- Organic, flowing shape
- Subtle particle effects or sparkles
- Should look like a condensed, crystallized form of ectoplasm
- Bright enough to be visible but not overpowering

The texture should represent the raw ectoplasm material that drops
from the crystalized ectoplasm blocks.
