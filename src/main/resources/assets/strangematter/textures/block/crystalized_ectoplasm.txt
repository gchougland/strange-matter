Crystalized Ectoplasm Block Texture
====================================

This should be a 16x16 pixel texture with the following characteristics:

- Primary color: #41b280 (teal-green)
- SEMI-TRANSPARENT: Use alpha channel for transparency (50-70% opacity)
- Crystal cluster appearance with multiple crystal facets
- Sharp, angular crystal shapes
- Bright, glowing appearance to match the light level
- Some variation in brightness across the crystal faces
- Subtle highlights and shadows to give depth
- The texture should have transparent/translucent areas

The texture should look like a cluster of small crystals growing together,
similar to amethyst clusters but with the specified teal-green color and
semi-transparency so you can see through the crystal.
