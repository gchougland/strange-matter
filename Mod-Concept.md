# ⚡ The Anomalies Mod – Concept

## Core Idea

The world is dotted with strange, unpredictable **anomalies** — rips in reality, weird physical effects, clusters of impossible matter.

Players can **study, stabilize, and harness** these anomalies, gaining access to bizarre mechanics that feel both dangerous and rewarding.

---

## 🔍 Discovery & Mystery

- **Procedural Anomalies** spawn randomly in the world, like rare structures or natural features.
- Each anomaly has **unique rules of physics** — e.g.:
    - A **Gravimetric Rift**: blocks and mobs float upward in its field.
    - A **Temporal Distortion**: day/night cycles flicker rapidly nearby.
    - A **Spatial Loop**: walking in one direction loops you back.
    - A **Shadow Zone**: blocks become intangible at night.
- Some anomalies are passive curiosities, others are dangerous hazards.
- They don’t come with obvious instructions — players must **experiment** to figure out what they do.

---

## ⚗️ Research & Progression

- Introduce an **Anomaly Research Table** (similar vibe to Thaumcraft’s Arcane Table).
- Players collect **anomaly samples** (crystals, particles, “residues”) using special containment tools.
- Studying anomalies unlocks a **research web** of traits:
    - Gravity Control
    - Time Warping
    - Spatial Distortion
    - Energy Resonance
- Progression is nonlinear: you unlock abilities based on the types of anomalies you’ve found in your world.

---

## 🔮 Harnessing Anomalies

Once studied, anomalies can be **stabilized and built into contraptions**:

- **Gravity Fields** – levitation pads, falling-block launchers, zero-g chambers.
- **Temporal Nodes** – slow-time bubbles, crop acceleration, stasis storage.
- **Spatial Anchors** – teleporters, pocket dimensions, recursive storage chests.
- **Resonant Energy** – a new “weird power system” that isn’t just RF/FE, but glitchy and unpredictable.

*(Imagine blending Thaumcraft’s research with Mekanism-style multiblock structures, but all themed around “paranormal physics.”)*

---

## 🌌 Emergent Gameplay

- Each world generates a **unique set of anomalies**, making exploration feel fresh every run.
- Some anomalies interact — a temporal field near a gravity well might create **unstable chain reactions**.
- Dangerous “runaway anomalies” could spawn if players mess with things irresponsibly (like Thaumcraft’s taint or Blood Magic’s backlash).

---

## 🎨 Atmosphere & Aesthetic

- Visuals: shimmering distortions, glitchy particles, warped light.
- Audio: faint hums, whispers, static pops, unsettling tones.
- The vibe: part-scientific, part-supernatural. Like **SCP Foundation meets Thaumcraft**.

---

## Why It’d Be a Classic

- **Unique Flavor**: no existing mod has gone deep into “paranormal anomalies as mechanics.”
- **Replayability**: anomalies vary per world, like roguelike seeds.
- **Modpack Friendly**: can stand alone or mesh with tech/magic packs (e.g., anomalies as exotic power sources).
- **Mystery**: no fixed storyline, just systems that *feel* like mysteries you unravel through play.

---

This would give the player the same kind of **“first time Thaumcraft” wonder** — where you’re poking at a system you don’t fully understand — but with a fresh sci-fi/paranormal twist.

# ⚡ Anomalies Mod Progression Tree

## **Tier 1 – The Unexplained**

The “wonder and fear” stage. You stumble across anomalies, but can’t interact deeply yet.

- **Raw Anomalies Spawn Naturally**
    - Gravity Wells, Spatial Loops, Temporal Flares, Radiation Zones, Echoing Shadows, etc.
    - Some beneficial (floating islands, accelerated crops), some dangerous (time-freeze traps, block decay).
- **Observation Tools** (crafted with basic materials + anomaly residue found nearby):
    - **Field Scanner** → Detects nearby anomalies with a compass-like interface.
    - **Resonance Meter** → Shows instability levels, danger ratings.
- **Goal**: Teach the player to notice, approach carefully, and document.

---

## **Tier 2 – Containment & Sampling**

Like SCP research containment: risky, but necessary.

- **Containment Tools**:
    - **Anomaly Jars / Sample Vials** → Collect fragments of anomalous matter.
    - **Shielded Containers** → Store samples without corruption/leakage.
- **Anomaly Research Table**:
    - Research samples to unlock traits in the **Research Web**.
    - Each anomaly gives partial knowledge → encourages exploring multiple anomaly types.
- **Unstable Samples**: mishandling them can cause micro-anomalies in your base (e.g., floating items, sudden mob spawns).
- **Goal**: Move from fear → curiosity → basic mastery.

---

## **Tier 3 – Stabilization**

Now you can actually control anomalies, but only barely.

- **Stabilization Field Generators**: small devices placed near anomalies to prevent them from spreading/decaying.
- **Harnessing Minor Effects**:
    - Gravity nodes → levitation pads.
    - Temporal crystals → speed up furnaces/crops.
    - Spatial shards → pocket storage chests.
- **Instability Risk**: push them too far and they “run away” → tearing holes in terrain, spawning hostile anomaly mobs, or even creating new random anomalies.
- **Goal**: Learn balance between utility and chaos.

---

## **Tier 4 – Engineering Anomalies**

Now you’re building with them — SCP-style research leads to applications.

- **Custom Anomaly Chambers**: multiblock structures for harnessing specific phenomena.
    - **Temporal Chamber** → slow-time field (mob traps, stasis storage).
    - **Spatial Chamber** → teleporters, wormholes, recursive bases.
    - **Gravitational Chamber** → anti-gravity rooms, asteroid miners.
- **Resonant Power Grid**: anomalies leak **Resonant Energy**, a chaotic new power source.
    - Stronger than RF/FE, but unstable. Overload causes distortions (e.g., mobs merging together, time stutters).
- **Goal**: You’re no longer just a researcher — you’re an **anomaly engineer**.

---

## **Tier 5 – Controlled Abnormality**

Endgame: becoming the “Foundation.”

- **Synthetic Anomalies**: craft your own anomalies by combining fragments.
    - Hybrid effects (Gravity + Temporal = stasis prison fields).
- **Portable Devices**: anomaly grenades, distortion projectors, pocket wormhole tools.
- **World-Bending Structures**:
    - Create **Pocket Dimensions** (like Mystcraft, but glitchier).
    - Stabilize a **Resonant Core** → an endgame power source rivaling any tech mod reactor.
- **The Risk Curve**: total mastery is impossible — anomalies are inherently unstable. The more you rely on them, the more unpredictable your world becomes.

---

## 🎨 Aesthetic & Atmosphere Notes

- **Thaumcraft-style research UI** → A web of interconnected anomaly traits (Gravity, Time, Space, Energy, Shadow, Perception).
- **SCP vibes** → containment procedures, classified reports, risk ratings (Safe / Euclid / Keter-style categories).
- **Emergent storytelling** → no fixed plot, but the *world itself becomes a mystery* as anomalies pile up and interact.

---

✅ This gives you:

- **A clear progression curve** (exploration → study → containment → harnessing → synthetic anomalies).
- **Replayability** (each world’s anomalies differ, making discovery fresh).
- **Mystery** (the more you poke, the stranger things get).

# ⚡ Anomaly Bestiary

---

## 👾 Anomalous Mobs

1. **Static Husk** – *Euclid*
    - A shambling humanoid made of static/particles. Flickers in and out of existence.
    - **Effect:** Can phase through walls, drops “Static Residue.”
    - **Use:** Residue → invisibility fields, phasing tools.
2. **Echo Beast** – *Keter*
    - Generates from Echoing Shadows. Resembles a warped version of a nearby mob.
    - **Effect:** Mimics player/mob attacks, but stronger.
    - **Use:** Contained essence can be forged into “Mirror Blades” that duplicate attacks.
3. **Paradox Slime** – *Euclid*
    - Splits infinitely when hit — but each clone is smaller and *heavier*.
    - **Effect:** Can eventually crush blocks under its own weight.
    - **Use:** Farmed for “Paradox Gel,” used in weight-based machines or anti-gravity potions.
4. **Glass Walker** – *Euclid*
    - Humanoid anomaly that only exists in reflections (water, glass).
    - **Effect:** Attacks players when looked at in mirrors.
    - **Use:** Captured shards → reflective armor that blinds enemies.
5. **Residual Entity** – *Safe → Keter*
- Neutral ghost-like mobs generated when anomalies collapse.
- **Effect:** Wanders aimlessly unless provoked.
- **Use:** Can be bound into blocks as “anomaly fuel.” If ignored too long → mutates into hostile form.

---

## 🧩 Anomalous Items

1. **Redshift Crystal** – *Euclid*
- Glowing shard from a collapsed temporal bloom.
- **Use:** Can slow or speed time locally. Dangerous if overcharged.
1. **Spatial Anchor** – *Safe*
- Craftable device that prevents anomaly drift.
- **Use:** Anchors teleporters, prevents runaway anomalies from spreading.
1. **Mirror Core** – *Keter*

- **Use:** Energy absorber, shielding device. Overuse → destabilizes player’s inventory.
1. **Paradox Cube** – *Euclid/Keter*
- Shifts form when interacted with. May become a block, item, mob, or nothing.
- **Use:** Rare crafting component, but unreliable.

---

## 🏚️ Anomalous Structures

1. **The Whispering Monolith** – *Euclid*
- A tall obsidian-like pillar emitting faint whispers.
- **Effect:** Standing near gives cryptic “hints” about anomalies.
- **Use:** Study boosts anomaly research, but too much exposure drains sanity (effects like nausea).
1. **Collapsed Research Outpost** – *Safe → Euclid*
- Ruins of an old “Foundation” camp. Contains notes, anomaly fragments, broken containment chambers.
- **Use:** Loot, lore, and rare containment tech blueprints.
1. **Resonant Singularity** – *Keter*

- **Use:** Bound reflection energy → decorative illusions or reflective weapons.
1. **Impossible Staircase** – *Euclid*
- Generated structure where stairs loop infinitely upward/downward.
- **Use:** Natural infinite mob spawner or endless storage loop. Breaking one block destabilizes it.

---

## 🌟 Why This Works

- **Mobs** add the fear/chaos factor — strange encounters that feel SCP-like.
- **Items** give the player tangible rewards to integrate anomalies into gameplay.
- **Structures** serve as “lore breadcrumbs” + exploration hooks.
- **Phenomena** remain the core: systems that warp physics.

Together they give the mod that *Thaumcraft-level depth* but with SCP weirdness.

# 🔬 Research Mechanic: “Fieldwork and Containment”

## **Step 1 – First Contact**

- Player encounters an anomaly in the wild.
- Using a **Resonance Scanner** (crafted from quartz + anomaly residue), they can scan it.
- Each scan yields **Research Points** in one or more **Anomaly Aspects**:
    - **Gravity** – Weight, levitation, collapse.
    - **Time** – Acceleration, stasis, aging.
    - **Space** – Teleportation, loops, compression.
    - **Energy** – Radiation, resonance, instability.
    - **Shadow** – Light, perception, echoes.
    - **Cognition** – Player senses, illusions, psychological anomalies.

*(These replace Thaumcraft’s primal aspects, but grounded in “anomaly physics.”)*

---

## **Step 2 – Containment & Sampling**

- Optional, riskier stage.
- Player can craft **Containment Tools** (Sample Jars, Anchors, Stabilizers).
- Containing a piece of an anomaly yields **rare research points** (like +Shadow from Echo Beasts, +Time from Temporal Blooms).
- Risk: failed containment can create a **mini-anomaly outbreak** in your base.

---

## **Step 3 – Research Interface**

- At the **Anomaly Research Table**, players spend points to unlock nodes in a **Research Web**.
- Each node represents a **concept**, which can unlock:
    - Recipes (containment tools, anomaly devices).
    - Field procedures (new ways to safely scan anomalies).
    - Harnessed powers (stabilized gravity pads, temporal chambers).
- Research Web is semi-random per world (nodes shift slightly), to emphasize mystery & replayability.

---

## **Step 4 – Minigame (Optional Layer)**

- Instead of just clicking nodes, unlocking research involves a **puzzle-like mechanic**.
    - E.g. connecting anomaly traits in a network (like Thaumcraft’s old aspect puzzle).
    - Or arranging “waveforms” to resonate (fit sine waves together for stability).
    - Failures may spawn “Residual Entities” or leak instability into your base.

---

# 🕸️ Research Web (Diagram Outline)

*(Imagine a circular, branching web where aspects radiate outward — like Thaumcraft’s research tree, but more “scientific notebook + SCP red strings.”)*

```
                 [COGNITION]
                     |
   [SHADOW]----[FOUNDATION]----[TIME]
      |                          |
   [ENERGY]------------------[SPACE]
                     |
                 [GRAVITY]

```

- **Foundation Node (Center):** Unlocks basic tools (Scanner, Research Table, Containment Jar).
- **Branches:**
    - **Gravity Path:** → Levitation Pads → Gravitational Chambers → Synthetic Black Holes.
    - **Time Path:** → Crop Accelerators → Stasis Storage → Temporal Loops.
    - **Space Path:** → Pocket Storage → Teleporters → Dimensional Anchors.
    - **Energy Path:** → Resonant Batteries → Instability Reactors → Reality Benders.
    - **Shadow Path:** → Camouflage Blocks → Shadow Weapons → Echo Summons.
    - **Cognition Path:** → Illusion Generators → Perception Filters → Dream Realms.

Each “tier” costs more points and requires multiple aspects.

For example:

- To unlock **Stasis Storage** → requires both **Time + Space**.
- To unlock **Echo Summons** → requires **Shadow + Cognition**.

---

# 🧩 Example Player Flow

1. Player finds a **Temporal Bloom**, scans it → gains +2 Time Points.
2. Back at the Research Table, spends points to unlock “Temporal Stability.”
3. Unlocks recipe for a **Containment Clock** (slows crops/mobs).
4. Later finds an **Echoing Shadow**, gets +Shadow Points.
5. Combining Time + Shadow unlocks **Paradox Mirror** → stores mobs in reflection.

---

# 🎨 Aesthetic

- The research screen looks like a **classified SCP file crossed with a conspiracy board**.
- Nodes = anomaly traits pinned with red string between them.
- Each discovery feels like piecing together hidden knowledge, not just “tech progression.”

---

✅ This ties the **mystery of anomalies** into a tangible gameplay loop:

- Exploration feeds research.
- Research unlocks tools.
- Tools let you interact with weirder anomalies.
- Which feed back into deeper research.

# 🧪 Research Minigame: **Anomaly Lab Board**

Instead of just “click unlock,” every research attempt opens a **Research Board**:

- A grid/board filled with **modular gadgets**.
- Each gadget represents an **Anomaly Aspect** (Time, Space, Gravity, Energy, Shadow, Cognition).
- To succeed, you must **align or stabilize all active gadgets simultaneously** until the “resonance meter” fills.
- Failure causes a **research backlash** (instability events, spawning anomaly mobs, or corrupting samples).

---

## 🔧 Gadget Examples (One per Aspect)

### 1. **Waveform Oscillator (Energy)**

- Displays multiple sine waves of different frequencies.
- Player adjusts sliders/knobs to overlap them into a stable single waveform.
- If aligned → anomaly stabilizes. If off → resonance interference builds.

---

### 2. **Chronometer Dial (Time)**

- A clock face with three hands (past, present, future).
- Player must align them in correct sequence based on a “time drift” clue.
- Misalignment → sudden fast-forward or rewind of nearby time (tools break, crops overgrow).

---

### 3. **Gravitational Indicator (Gravity)**

- A scale/needle device that swings erratically.
- Player must balance the needle at “zero-G” using weights or counterforces.
- Overstabilizing → mini-black hole event (items/mobs pulled in).

---

### 4. **Spatial Calibrator (Space)**

- A 3D wireframe cube on the board twists and folds like a Rubik’s cube.
- Player rotates planes until the cube “resolves” into a stable orientation.
- Wrong alignment → player gets looped in place, stuck until puzzle ends.

---

### 5. **Shadow Lens (Shadow)**

- A lens reveals “invisible” runes or shadows on the board.
- Player must rotate mirrors/lenses to project light onto hidden glyphs.
- Failure → spawns hostile shadow phantoms.

---

### 6. **Cognitive Pattern Grid (Cognition)**

- A scrambled grid of symbols (triangle, eye, spiral, infinity, etc.).
- Player must reorder them into a logical sequence (like solving a mental puzzle).
- Wrong order → screen glitches, UI flickers, player debuffed with nausea/confusion.

---

## 🕹️ Research Session Flow

1. Player inserts **samples** into the Research Table → anomaly aspects determine which gadgets activate.
    - Example: Studying a Temporal Bloom activates **Chronometer + Waveform Oscillator**.
2. Player interacts with gadgets on the board in real-time.
3. Each gadget solved contributes to the **Resonance Bar**.
4. Fill the bar → unlocks research node → new recipes/abilities.
5. Fail a gadget → anomaly backlash.

---

## 🎨 Aesthetic

- Board looks like a **retro control panel**: knobs, dials, oscilloscopes, mirrors, glyph readers.
- Atmosphere = half **old-school lab gear**, half **eldritch containment console**.
- Sound design:
    - Oscillator hums and static.
    - Clock ticks.
    - Gravity meter groans when unbalanced.
    - Shadow Lens whispers faintly.

---

## 🎲 Scaling Difficulty

- Early research: only **1–2 gadgets** active per attempt.
- Mid-game: **3–4 gadgets**, sometimes interlinked (fixing Gravity throws off Time).
- Late-game: **all 6 gadgets**, requiring balancing multiple systems at once.

This gives that **“mad scientist juggling anomalies” feel** — like you’re in a containment lab keeping reality itself from breaking while you poke at it.

---

✅ This nails:

- **Mystery & tension** (every attempt could fail spectacularly).
- **Replayability** (each anomaly activates different gadgets).
- **Player mastery curve** (you *get good* at stabilizing the lab over time).

# ⚡ Anomalies Mod – Research Progression Tree

Each **Tier** expands what the board throws at you (more gadgets active, more instability), while also unlocking deeper gameplay systems.

---

    - Handheld Wormhole Projectors.
    - Resonant Shields (absorb damage with anomalies).
- **Final Chamber:** **The Resonant Core Reactor** → Endgame energy source, but dangerously unstable.
- **Mastery Board:** Occasionally throws **all 6 gadgets at once** for “world-bending” research sessions.

**Gameplay Impact:**

You’re effectively **the SCP Foundation** of your world: cataloguing, experimenting, and weaponizing anomalies. But instability never goes away — pushing too far risks catastrophic fallout.

---

# 🕹️ How It All Feels

- **Early Game:** Curiosity → scanning weird stuff and poking it carefully.
- **Mid Game:** Containment → juggling the lab board while trying not to blow yourself up.
- **Late Game:** Engineering → anomalies become integrated into your contraptions, bases, and even combat.
- **Endgame:** Temptation → wielding godlike anomaly powers at the cost of ever-growing instability.

---

This progression ties directly into the **Research Board mini-game**:

- Tier 1–2: Only a couple gadgets active at once.
- Tier 3–4: You’re actively **balancing multiple devices** under time pressure.
- Tier 5: Full chaos — stabilizing all aspects simultaneously feels like “containing reality itself.”
